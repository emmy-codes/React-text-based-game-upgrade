# React-text-based-game-upgrade

Taking the first project I ever used Javascript in (and had a lot of help with what I needed to use to make things happen, since I really wasn't capable of producing this alone at the time) and remaking it in React.

Here I'm going to:

* Split into what I think are the right components
* Find better solutions to the newbie workarounds I made
* Add more content!
