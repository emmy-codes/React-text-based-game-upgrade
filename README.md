# React-text-based-game-upgrade

Taking the first project I ever used Javascript in (and had a lot of help with what I needed to use to make things happen, since I really wasn't capable of producing this alone at the time) and remaking it in React.

Here I'm going to:

* Split into what I think are the right Components
* Improve the links between "pages" using Route and links
* Use props for input reactions
* Find a way to solve the issue of currently being able to go to any square when typing "Go X" (shouldn't be able to Go North when on East square etc)
* Other improvements to be discovered!
* More content
